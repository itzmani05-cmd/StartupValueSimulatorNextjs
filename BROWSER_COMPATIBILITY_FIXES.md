# Browser Compatibility Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to address browser compatibility warnings.

## CSS Fixes Applied

1. **Text Size Adjust Warnings**:
   - Removed redundant `-ms-text-size-adjust` and `-webkit-text-size-adjust` prefixes
   - Kept standard `text-size-adjust: 100%` which is supported by modern browsers

2. **User Select Warnings**:
   - Removed redundant `-moz-user-select` and `-ms-user-select` prefixes
   - Kept `-webkit-user-select: none` for Safari support
   - Kept standard `user-select: none`

3. **Text Decoration Skip Warnings**:
   - Removed redundant `-webkit-text-decoration-skip: objects` declarations
   - Kept standard `text-decoration-skip-ink: auto` which is supported by modern browsers

## HTML Fixes Applied

1. **Charset Declarations**:
   - All HTML files already had correct `<meta charset="utf-8" />` declarations
   - No changes needed

## Notes on Unaddressed Warnings

Some warnings relate to server-level configurations that cannot be fixed in HTML/CSS files:

1. **Meta Theme-Color**:
   - Warning: Not supported by Firefox
   - Status: Retained as it provides value for other browsers (Chrome, Safari, etc.)

2. **Security Headers**:
   - Warnings about "Expires", "X-Frame-Options", and "x-xss-protection" headers
   - Status: These must be configured at the server level

3. **Cache Busting**:
   - Warning about resource URLs not matching configured patterns
   - Status: This is handled by the build process and server configuration

## Files Modified

1. `src/styles/globals.css` - Removed redundant vendor prefixes
2. All HTML files already had correct charset declarations

These changes improve browser compatibility while maintaining the same visual appearance and functionality.
