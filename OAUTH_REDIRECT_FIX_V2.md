# OAuth Redirect Fix V2

## Issue Description

The Google OAuth authentication was working correctly (users could sign in), but after successful authentication, the application wasn't redirecting to the user-specific dashboard. Instead, it was staying on the same page.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a timing problem in the OAuth callback handler. The handler was trying to redirect to the user-specific URL before the AuthContext had been updated with the user information. This resulted in either no redirect or a redirect to an incorrect URL.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced OAuth Callback Handler

The [OAuthCallbackHandler.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/components/OAuthCallbackHandler.tsx) was updated to:

1. Use a useEffect hook to watch for user changes in the AuthContext
2. Automatically redirect to the user-specific dashboard once the user context is updated
3. Simplify the redirect logic to be more reliable

### 2. Improved LoginPage Handler

The [LoginPage.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx) was updated to:

1. Add a small delay before redirecting to ensure the AuthContext is updated
2. Improve the reliability of the redirect after successful login

### 3. Better State Management

The solution now properly manages the authentication state by:

1. Setting the user in the AuthContext
2. Watching for user changes with useEffect
3. Redirecting only when the user context is properly updated

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" button
2. OAuth flow is initiated and user authenticates with Google
3. Google redirects back to the OAuth callback handler
4. OAuth callback handler retrieves the session and sets the user in AuthContext
5. useEffect hook in OAuthCallbackHandler detects the user change
6. User is automatically redirected to their specific dashboard at `#/user/{user_id}`

## Testing the Fix

1. Sign in with Google OAuth
2. You should now be automatically redirected to your user-specific dashboard after successful authentication
3. The URL should be in the format `#/user/{your_user_id}`

## Error Handling

The updated OAuth callback handler now provides specific error redirects:

- `#/login?error=oauth_failed` - General OAuth failure
- `#/login?error=user_id_not_found` - User ID not found in session
- `#/login` - No session found

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Timing Issues

The useEffect hook watching for user changes ensures that redirection only happens when the AuthContext is properly updated.

### 2. State Management

The solution properly manages the authentication state through the React context.

### 3. Error Handling

Specific error codes help identify and debug different failure scenarios.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive logging to track the authentication flow
2. Implement automatic retries if navigation fails
3. Add visual indicators during the OAuth process
4. Improve error messages for common OAuth issues
