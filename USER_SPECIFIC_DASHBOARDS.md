# User-Specific Dashboards Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of user-specific dashboards where each user has a unique URL for their dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Routing System Updates

The routing system in [main.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/main.tsx) has been updated to support user-specific URLs:

- Added support for `/user/:id` routes
- Added support for `/user/:id/company/:id` routes
- Updated route resolution logic to handle parameterized routes

### 2. OAuth Callback Handler

The [OAuthCallbackHandler.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/components/OAuthCallbackHandler.tsx) has been updated to redirect users to their specific dashboard URL after successful authentication:

- Redirects to `#/user/{user_id}` instead of generic `#/app`
- Maintains session verification before redirecting

### 3. Login Process

The [LoginPage.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx) has been updated to redirect users to their specific dashboard URL after login:

- Uses AuthContext to get the current user's ID
- Redirects to `#/user/{user_id}` for authenticated users
- Falls back to generic `#/app` route if user ID is not available

### 4. App Component

The [App.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/App.tsx) component has been updated to accept a userId prop:

- Added userId to the AppProps interface
- Updated component signature to accept userId prop

## URL Structure

The new URL structure for user-specific dashboards:

1. **User Dashboard**: `#/user/{user_id}`
2. **User Company Dashboard**: `#/user/{user_id}/company/{company_id}`

## Benefits

1. **Personalization**: Each user has a unique URL for their dashboard
2. **Security**: User-specific URLs can be used for access control
3. **Analytics**: Easier to track user-specific activity
4. **Bookmarking**: Users can bookmark their specific dashboard URL

## Testing

To test the user-specific dashboards:

1. Sign in with Google OAuth or email/password
2. After successful authentication, you should be redirected to `#/user/{your_user_id}`
3. The dashboard should load with your user-specific data
4. You can bookmark this URL for future access

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom User Slugs**: Instead of user IDs, allow users to have custom slugs (e.g., `#/user/john-doe`)
2. **User Profile Pages**: Create public profile pages at user-specific URLs
3. **Sharing**: Allow users to share their dashboard URLs with others
4. **Access Control**: Implement access control based on user-specific URLs
