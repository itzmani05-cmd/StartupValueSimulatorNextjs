# OAuth Redirect and User Data Storage Fix

## Issues Addressed

1. **OAuth Redirect Issue**: Users were not being redirected to their dashboard after successful Google OAuth authentication
2. **User Data Storage**: Ensuring user data is properly stored in the database with each user having their ID

## Root Cause Analysis

### OAuth Redirect Issue

The problem was in the route resolution logic in [main.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/main.tsx). The parameterized routes like `/user/{user_id}` were not being correctly matched against the ROUTES mapping, causing the application to default to the login page instead of the app dashboard.

### User Data Storage Issue

While the AuthContext was attempting to store user data, there were no proper error handling mechanisms and no explicit database updates for OAuth users.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Route Resolution Logic

Updated the route resolution logic in [main.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/main.tsx) to properly handle parameterized routes:

1. Added explicit pattern matching for `/user/:id` routes
2. Added explicit pattern matching for `/user/:id/company/:id` routes
3. Ensured these routes are correctly resolved to the 'app' route type

### 2. Improved OAuth Callback Handler

Enhanced [OAuthCallbackHandler.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/components/OAuthCallbackHandler.tsx) with comprehensive user data handling:

1. **Database Integration**: Explicitly check if user exists in database and create/update records accordingly
2. **Last Login Tracking**: Update the last_login timestamp for existing users
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for both OAuth and database operations
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Continue with redirect even if database operations fail
5. **User Data Consistency**: Ensure user data is consistent between OAuth session and database records

### 3. Better User Data Management

The solution now properly manages user data by:

1. Checking if the user already exists in the database
2. Creating new user records for first-time OAuth users
3. Updating existing user records with latest login information
4. Maintaining data consistency between Supabase Auth and the users table

## How It Works

### OAuth Flow

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" button
2. OAuth flow is initiated and user authenticates with Google
3. Google redirects back to the OAuth callback handler (`/#/auth/callback`)
4. OAuth callback handler:
   - Retrieves the OAuth session
   - Extracts user information
   - Checks if user exists in database
   - Creates or updates user record in database
   - Sets user in AuthContext
   - Redirects to user-specific dashboard (`#/user/{user_id}`)

### Route Resolution

1. When the URL changes to `#/user/{user_id}`, the route resolution logic:
   - Matches the pattern against known routes
   - Correctly identifies it as an 'app' route
   - Extracts the user ID from the URL
   - Passes the user ID to the App component

## Database Schema Compliance

The solution works with the existing database schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name TEXT,
    phone TEXT,
    company TEXT,
    role TEXT,
    preferences JSONB,
    last_login TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Testing the Fix

### OAuth Redirect Testing

1. Sign in with Google OAuth
2. You should be automatically redirected to your user-specific dashboard
3. The URL should be in the format `#/user/{your_user_id}`
4. Check browser console for any error messages

### User Data Storage Testing

1. Check the database to ensure user records are created/updated
2. Verify that the last_login field is updated on each login
3. Confirm that user data is consistent between OAuth session and database

## Error Handling

The solution includes comprehensive error handling:

- `#/login?error=oauth_failed` - General OAuth failure
- `#/login?error=timeout` - Authentication process taking too long
- `#/login` - No session found
- Database errors are logged but don't prevent redirection

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive logging for debugging purposes
2. Implement automatic retries for database operations
3. Add visual indicators during the OAuth process
4. Improve error messages for common OAuth issues
5. Add user profile completion flow for new OAuth users
