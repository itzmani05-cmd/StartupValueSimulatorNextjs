#### Development Guidelines

##### TypeScript Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict type checking
- Provide comprehensive type definitions
- Use interfaces for complex data structures
- Leverage generics for reusable components

##### React Best Practices
- Follow functional component patterns
- Use hooks appropriately (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Optimize performance with React.memo and useCallback
- Maintain component composability

##### Component Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose
- **Reusability**: Design components to be reusable across contexts
- **Accessibility**: Implement proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure components work on all screen sizes
- **Performance**: Optimize rendering and avoid unnecessary re-renders

##### Styling Guidelines
- Use the established design system tokens
- Follow the professional color palette
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

#### Testing Requirements

##### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain 80%+ code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

##### Integration Tests
- Test API integrations thoroughly
- Validate data flow between components
- Test state management transitions
- Verify business logic accuracy

##### End-to-End Tests
- Test critical user workflows
- Validate cross-browser compatibility
- Test responsive design behavior
- Verify accessibility compliance

#### Code Quality Standards

##### Linting and Formatting
- Follow ESLint configuration rules
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Maintain consistent code style
- Address all linting warnings
- Use meaningful variable and function names

##### Documentation
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Document new APIs and interfaces
- Update user guides when features change
- Include examples for complex functionality

##### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

Types:
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Test additions/updates
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

Example:
```
feat(founders): add equal split distribution utility

Add button to automatically distribute equity equally among founders
with validation to ensure proper allocation.

Closes #123
```

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create Pull Request**: Push your branch and create a PR
2. **Description**: Provide a clear description of changes
3. **Link Issues**: Reference related issues or feature requests
4. **Review Request**: Request review from maintainers
5. **Address Feedback**: Respond to review comments
6. **Merge**: Once approved, PR will be merged

##### PR Requirements
- All tests must pass
- Code coverage must meet minimum requirements
- Documentation must be updated
- Code must follow established patterns
- Changes must be reviewed by at least one maintainer

#### Financial Calculation Accuracy

Since this is a financial application, special care must be taken with calculations:

1. **Precision**: Use appropriate decimal precision
2. **Rounding**: Implement consistent rounding rules
3. **Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation
4. **Testing**: Include extensive test cases
5. **Documentation**: Document calculation methodologies

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Calculate dilution impact for funding rounds
 * 
 * Formula: New Share Price = Pre-Money Valuation / Total Shares
 *          Shares Issued = Investment Amount / New Share Price
 *          Post-Round Ownership % = Shares Issued / (Total Shares + Shares Issued)
 * 
 * @param preMoneyValuation - Company valuation before investment
 * @param investmentAmount - Amount being invested
 * @param totalShares - Current total shares outstanding
 * @returns Dilution calculation results
 */
const calculateDilution = (
  preMoneyValuation: number,
  investmentAmount: number,
  totalShares: number
): DilutionResult => {
  // Implementation with proper validation and error handling
}
```

#### Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
2. **Authentication**: Follow security best practices
3. **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive information
4. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive data in errors
5. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date

#### Performance Optimization

1. **Bundle Size**: Minimize bundle size impact
2. **Rendering**: Optimize component rendering
3. **Data Fetching**: Implement efficient data loading
4. **Caching**: Use appropriate caching strategies
5. **Lazy Loading**: Implement code splitting where appropriate
