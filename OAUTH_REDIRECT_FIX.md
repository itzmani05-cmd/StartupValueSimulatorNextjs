# OAuth Redirect Fix

## Issue Description

The Google OAuth authentication was working correctly (users could sign in), but after successful authentication, the application wasn't automatically redirecting to the main app component. Instead, it was staying on the same page.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a race condition between the OAuth callback handler and the AuthProvider's initialization. The OAuthCallbackHandler was trying to redirect to `#/app` before the AuthProvider had finished processing the authentication state, which caused the redirect to fail.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced OAuth Callback Handler

The [OAuthCallbackHandler.tsx](file:///c%3A/Users/welcome/Desktop/StartupValueSimulator/startup-simulator-next/src/components/OAuthCallbackHandler.tsx) was updated to:

1. Properly use the `setUser` function from the AuthContext to set the user state
2. Add a longer delay (300ms) before redirecting to ensure state updates are processed
3. Verify the session is still valid before redirecting
4. Add better error handling with specific error codes for different failure scenarios

### 2. Improved Redirect Logic

The redirect logic now includes:

1. Setting the user state in the AuthContext
2. Waiting for the state to be properly set
3. Verifying the session is still valid before redirecting
4. Providing specific error redirects for different failure scenarios

## Testing the Fix

1. Sign in with Google OAuth
2. You should now be automatically redirected to the main app after successful authentication
3. If automatic navigation still doesn't work, check the browser console for any errors

## Error Handling

The updated OAuth callback handler now provides specific error redirects:

- `#/login?error=oauth_failed` - General OAuth failure
- `#/login?error=session_not_found` - Session not found after OAuth
- `#/login?error=session_check_failed` - Error checking session validity

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Timing Issues

The longer delay (300ms) helps ensure the authentication state is properly set before navigation.

### 2. Session Validation

The session verification step ensures that the user is still authenticated before redirecting.

### 3. Error Handling

Specific error codes help identify and debug different failure scenarios.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive logging to track the authentication flow
2. Implement automatic retries if navigation fails
3. Add visual indicators during the OAuth process
4. Improve error messages for common OAuth issues
